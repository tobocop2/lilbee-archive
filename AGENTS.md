# lilbee — Development Guide

## Before You Write Code (read this every time)

This file is long and the operational rules sit far down. These are the misses
that have cost the most review cycles. Apply them BEFORE writing, not after:

1. **Type external objects precisely.** Never `getattr(obj, "field", default)`
   on a field the object's type guarantees. Annotate the parameter with the
   real type and read the attribute directly. `getattr`-with-default is only
   for attributes that genuinely may not exist (dynamic reflection).
2. **Don't inherit the surrounding code's pattern without checking it against
   these rules.** Nearby code may predate a rule. Copying an adjacent
   `getattr` / `isinstance(self.app, ...)` / `: str` shape just propagates the
   smell into your diff.
3. **One-line docstrings by default.** Describe what the code IS, not how it
   got there. No "previously", "now also", "some versions", "kept for".
4. **The smell gate runs in `make lint`.** `scripts/check_style_rules.py` fails
   on any NEW Code-Smell Trigger (see that section) on lines your diff adds vs
   `main`. Run `make lint` before committing; a genuinely dynamic case opts out
   inline with `# style-check: allow-smell` plus a written reason.

The full rules follow; this block is the part that gets skipped under time
pressure, so it leads.

## Project
Local search engine you can talk to. Python 3.11+, pluggable LLM providers (a managed local `llama-server` fleet by default, Ollama/OpenAI via litellm), LanceDB for vectors. Managed with `uv`. Task tracking with `beads` (`bd`). Learned behaviors with `floop`.

**Framing:** Lead with "search engine" (a local search engine you can talk to) — not "RAG" or "local-first" (those are properties, not the identity). lilbee is both a standalone multipurpose tool AND an AI agent backend.

## Task Tracking (beads)
```bash
bd ready                      # See what's ready to work on
bd update <id> -s in_progress # Claim a task
bd close <id>                 # Mark done
bd list                       # All issues
```
Every code change MUST be tracked as a beads task. Create tasks before starting work, close them when done.

## Commands
```bash
uv sync                       # Install dependencies
make check                    # Run all checks: lint, format, typecheck, test (same as CI)
make test                     # Tests with coverage
make lint                     # Ruff linting
make typecheck                # Mypy
make format                   # Auto-format code
uv run lilbee init            # Create .lilbee/ in current dir (per-project DB)
uv run lilbee sync            # Sync documents to vector DB
uv run lilbee ask "question"
uv run lilbee chat
uv run lilbee status
uv run lilbee rebuild
```

## Architecture
- `src/lilbee/` — All source code
- Per-project DB: `lilbee init` creates `.lilbee/` in cwd (like `.git/`)
- Data location precedence: `--data-dir`/`LILBEE_DATA` > `.lilbee/` (walk up from cwd) > global platform default
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/lilbee/`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/lilbee/`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/lilbee/`
- All settings configurable via `LILBEE_*` env vars or CLI flags
- Auto-sync: documents/ is source of truth, data/ is rebuilt from it

## Configuration
All settings override via environment variables:
- `LILBEE_DATA` — data directory path
- `LILBEE_CHAT_MODEL` — LLM model (default: `qwen3:8b`)
- `LILBEE_EMBEDDING_MODEL` — embedding model (default: `nomic-embed-text`)
- `LILBEE_EMBEDDING_DIM` — embedding dimensions (default: `768`)
- `LILBEE_CHUNK_SIZE` — tokens per chunk (default: `512`)
- `LILBEE_CHUNK_OVERLAP` — overlap tokens (default: `100`)
- `LILBEE_TOP_K` — retrieval result count (default: `5`)
- `LILBEE_ANN_INDEX_THRESHOLD` — chunk count at/above which sync builds an approximate (ANN) vector index for fast search at scale (default: `50000`, `0` = always exact flat search)
- `LILBEE_MAX_DISTANCE` — cosine distance threshold, 0-1 (default: `0.9`). Higher = more results, lower = stricter filtering
- `LILBEE_ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD` — enable adaptive threshold widening (default: `false`). When true, widens distance threshold if too few results found
- `LILBEE_VISION_MODEL` — vision OCR model (default: none)
- `LILBEE_RERANKER_TYPE` — reranker serving mode: `auto` (default), `cross_encoder`, or `llm`.
- `LILBEE_RERANKER_PROMPT` — relevance prompt for LLM rerankers (blank uses the built-in template).
- `LILBEE_OCR_TIMEOUT` — per-page vision OCR timeout in seconds (default: `120`, `0` = no limit)
- `LILBEE_TESSERACT_TIMEOUT`: wall-clock timeout in seconds for the Tesseract OCR fallback (default: `60`, `0` = no limit). Only runs when no vision model is available.
- `LILBEE_SSE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` — seconds between SSE heartbeat events when the producer queue is idle (default: `30`). Set to `0` to disable.
- `LILBEE_LLM_PROVIDER` — provider: `auto` (default; runs models locally on the managed `llama-server` fleet) or `remote` (external OpenAI-compatible endpoint; requires `pip install lilbee[litellm]`).
- `LILBEE_LLAMA_SERVER_PATH`: path to a `llama-server` binary; when set it always wins, even over the bundled wheel (default: the bundled wheel's binary, else PATH)
- `LILBEE_OLLAMA_BASE_URL` — Ollama server URL (blank uses `http://localhost:11434`)
- `LILBEE_LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL` — LM Studio server URL (blank uses `http://localhost:1234/v1`)
- `LILBEE_DIVERSITY_MAX_PER_SOURCE` — max chunks per source in results (default: `3`)
- `LILBEE_MMR_LAMBDA` — MMR relevance/diversity tradeoff, 0-1 (default: `0.5`)
- `LILBEE_CANDIDATE_MULTIPLIER` — extra candidates for MMR reranking (default: `3`)
- `LILBEE_QUERY_EXPANSION_COUNT` — LLM-generated query variants, 0=disabled (default: `3`)
- `LILBEE_ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD_STEP` — distance threshold widening step (default: `0.2`). Only used when adaptive_threshold is true.
- `LILBEE_LOG_LEVEL` — logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR (default: `WARNING`)
- `LILBEE_NO_SPLASH` — set to any non-empty value to suppress the startup bee animation

CLI also accepts `--model` / `-m` for chat model, `--data-dir` / `-d`, `--ocr-timeout`, and `--log-level`.

## Code Quality Rules

### Test-Driven Development
- **100% test coverage required** — enforced by `pytest-cov` with `fail_under = 100`
- Write tests BEFORE or alongside implementation, not after
- Every public function MUST have at least one test
- **Every test must assert something meaningful** — no zero-assertion coverage padding
- Mock all external dependencies (LLM providers, filesystem I/O where needed) — tests must run without a live server
- Use `pytest.mark.skipif` only for integration tests that genuinely require live services
- Use `tmp_path` fixtures for filesystem tests — never write to real paths
- Test edge cases and error paths, not just the happy path
- Tests are documentation — name them descriptively (`test_add_nonexistent_fails`, not `test_add_3`)
- **Never run tests in background** — user must see output
- **Kill tests that hang past 2-3 minutes** — investigate the hang, don't wait
- **Integration tests must test real multi-system flows**, not mocked unit test duplicates
- Target only affected test files during development; full suite once at the end

### DRY & Modularity
- **Don't Repeat Yourself** — extract shared logic into helpers when duplicated
- Single Responsibility — each function does one thing well
- Small functions — max ~20 lines, max 2 levels of nesting
- Low cyclomatic complexity — extract helpers when branches exceed 3
- **Use maps for classification/dispatch** — if-chains that map values to categories belong in a dict, not repeated `if`/`elif` blocks
- Compose small functions rather than writing monolithic ones
- If you need to copy-paste code, refactor into a shared function instead

### Code Style
- No LangChain — provider abstraction (no raw SDK calls)
- Type hints on all public functions
- Dataclasses for structured return types (not raw dicts)
- **Named constants for magic numbers AND magic strings** — never use raw string literals when a constant exists. Grep globally for the raw value of any new constant to ensure no duplicates remain.
- **Closed value sets use `StrEnum` / `IntEnum`, not parallel module constants.** Two or more named values for the same field (status, mode, role, kind, event tag) is a sign of an enum. Define `class FooStatus(StrEnum)` so the field type can be `FooStatus` (Pydantic validates, mypy narrows, IDEs autocomplete) and the variants live in one namespace. Examples already in repo: `EventType`, `SseEvent`, `BatchStatus`, `WikiEntityMode`, `ChatMode`, `WireKind`, `ModelTask`, `BackendName`, `WorkerRole`. A bare module-level constant is only correct when the value stands alone (sentinel like `CRAWL_TOTAL_UNKNOWN = -1`) — not when it's one of a small fixed set.
- **String-typed parameters for closed sets are a smell.** A `task: str`, `kind: str`, `role: str`, `event_type: str` parameter signals the type system isn't carrying the constraint. Convert to the corresponding StrEnum at the boundary and let mypy enforce exhaustiveness on every dispatch site. HTTP / IPC boundaries decode the string into the enum (`ModelTask(value)` raises `ValueError` on bad input), production code never sees the bare string.
- **Sealed unions dispatch on a `kind` discriminator, not isinstance.** When you have a small, closed set of dataclasses sharing a common shape, give them a `kind: Literal["foo"]` field and dispatch on `row.kind == "foo"` (or `match row.kind`). The Literal makes mypy enforce exhaustiveness; isinstance chains scattered across many call sites do not.
- **Polymorphic getattr-with-default is a contract leak.** `getattr(row, "field", default)` only makes sense when the field genuinely doesn't exist on some union members. If every member should expose the field, declare it. If not, the dispatch dict is mistyped: tighten the type so the helper only sees members that carry the field, and split per-variant helpers when needed. The `getattr` fallback hides what the type should already say.
- **No positional array indexes** — use named constants or membership checks, not `array[0]`
- Descriptive variable names — `pending_segments` not `current`, `chunk_size` not `n`
- Logging with `logging.getLogger(__name__)` — no bare `except: pass`
- No hardcoded values — all configurable through `config.py` with env var overrides
- Imports: stdlib first, then third-party, then local — no star imports. See **Import Discipline** below for the rules on function-local imports.
- Linting: `ruff check` + `ruff format` (line length 100)
- Type checking: `mypy` with strict settings
- **No em dashes (—)** — use periods or commas instead
- **No divider comments** (`# ------`) for grouping — use modules or classes instead
- **Canonical module layout — group by kind, don't scatter.** A module reads top-to-bottom in this order: module docstring → `from __future__` → imports → module-level constants & data tables → enums → exception classes → data containers (`dataclass` / `TypedDict` / `NamedTuple` / `BaseModel`) → classes → functions. Within each band, order by concern, not by when each symbol was added. The reader should never have to scan past a `class` or `def` to find the next constant, nor past a constant to find the next class. A constant assignment (`FOO = ...`, `BAR: T = ...`) appearing AFTER the first `def`/`class` in a module is the scatter smell — hoist it into the constants band at the top. A `def` wedged into a run of `FOO = ...` / `BAR = ...` lines is the same smell from the other side. The one allowed exception: a single small helper that exists only to build or validate one adjacent group of constants may sit directly after that group (the constants, then their one helper) — but never interleaved (`A = ...`, `def f(): ...`, `B = ...` is always wrong). When in doubt, constants and data tables go at the top, contiguous; everything callable goes below, contiguous.
- **Annotate `isinstance` guards** with a comment explaining why the check is needed (e.g. untyped frontmatter, untyped SDK response). NEVER use `isinstance(self.app, LilbeeApp)` style host-narrowing in production: if a screen / widget needs LilbeeApp-specific access, declare `app: LilbeeApp  # type: ignore[assignment]` at the class scope (mypy narrows; runtime is unchanged). Tests host via `tests/_lilbee_app_test_host.LilbeeAppHost` (a LilbeeApp subclass with `_test_skip_auto_init = True`), never `App[None]` / `class _PlainApp(App)`.
- Use literal unicode chars (`★`) not escapes (`\u2605`); extract to named constants
- **No filterwarnings** without explicit user approval; fix warnings at the source
- **Docstrings describe what the code IS, not how it got there.** Drop iteration-tracking phrasing like "Accepts X so callers don't have to import Y", "Used by Z as the on_complete callback", "Moved here because…", "Replaces the previous getattr fallback". That information is the *change description*, not the function's contract. Default to one-line docstrings; add detail only for non-obvious invariants (Big-O bounds, ordering guarantees, error semantics). The `grep -rnE "so callers don'?t|used by .* as the|replaces the|moved here because|previously" src/` sweep should return zero new hits in a diff.
- **Inline comments state what, not a story.** A comment names a non-obvious invariant or constraint in one line. Cut the narration and justification: not "Best-effort convenience: a rejected swap must never be fatal, log it and keep the ref so the app boots", just "A rejected swap must not be fatal at startup". Not "the task is reclassified so the pick agrees with the validator that runs on the subsequent swap; a wrong-task model would be rejected downstream"; just "tasks are reclassified so the pick matches the role validator". Multi-sentence comment blocks that walk through the reasoning behind the code are the smell. Default to no comment; let names carry the meaning.

### Type-System Hygiene
- **Don't fight the type system with `# type: ignore` for owned attributes.** A `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` on `self.app.task_bar` means mypy can't see `task_bar`. Fix the source: declare `app: LilbeeApp` on the host class, declare `task_bar: TaskBarController` on LilbeeApp's `__init__`, and the ignore goes away. The ignore was the symptom; the missing declaration was the bug.
- **Adapter classes for SDK shape isolation.** When you find yourself reading the same external library response with `getattr(chunk, "field", default)` in three places, wrap the SDK shape once in a small `_LibFooView` adapter at the import boundary. All callers consume the typed adapter, the SDK shape lives in one file, and SDK drift breaks the adapter (a sharp signal) instead of silently degrading every caller.
- **`@overload` for stream / mode-narrowed returns.** A method that returns `str | Iterator[str]` based on a `stream: bool` flag is unhelpful: every caller `cast()`s away the union. Add `@overload` signatures for `Literal[True]` and `Literal[False]`; the body still accepts `bool`. Callers consuming `stream=True` get `Iterator[str]`, `stream=False` get `str`, and the `cast()` calls disappear from the call sites.
- **Module-level registries over `fn._marker = True`.** When a decorator marks functions for later lookup (e.g. read-only route handlers), keep the marker as a module-level `set[Callable]` and provide an `is_marked(fn)` predicate. The `fn._marker = True` pattern requires `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` everywhere it's read and is invisible to grep.
- **Bound-method dispatch dicts beat `getattr(self, name)` reflection.** When mapping command names / event types to handler methods, build a `dict[str, Callable]` in `__init__` from real bound methods (or a class-level registry decorator). `getattr(self, handler_name)(args)` reflection means mypy can't tell which methods exist, and a typo in `handler_name` becomes an `AttributeError` at runtime instead of a type error.
- **Encapsulate module globals on a class.** Three or more module-level mutable variables sharing a concept (`_callback`, `_installed`, `_pending`, `_pending_level`, `_lock`) form an implicit object. Promote to `class _ThingDispatcher: ...` with named methods and a single module-level instance. Tests get a clean snapshot/restore seam; production code stops needing `global` declarations.
- **No test-aware branches in production.** A production code path gated on `if isinstance(self.app, LilbeeApp)`, `if hasattr(self.app, "task_bar")`, or `if not _is_test_env()` is debt: it pollutes the production path with a fallback that exists only because tests mount differently. Fix tests to mount the production type (subclass with the heavy work skipped), and the production branch goes away entirely.

### Layering & Inversion

The package layers go bottom-up. A module may import from its own layer and any layer below; never above. New code must respect this.

| Layer | Packages | What lives here |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (foundation) | `core/` | Config singleton, settings I/O, security helpers, results. No upward imports. |
| 1 | `catalog/` | Featured catalog, HF ref helpers, downloads, **shared domain types** (`ModelTask`, `ModelSource`). |
| 2 | `modelhub/`, `providers/`, `runtime/`, `data/` | Model registry, lifecycle, providers, ingest pipeline. May import catalog + core. |
| 3 | `retrieval/`, `wiki/`, `crawler/` | Search, RAG, wiki generation, web crawl. May import any lower layer. |
| 4 (surfaces) | `app/`, `cli/`, `server/`, `mcp_server.py` | Use-case orchestration and surfaces. May import anything below. |

Concrete rules:

- **Domain types live in the lowest layer that uses them.** If `ModelTask` is referenced by `catalog/` and `modelhub/`, it belongs in `catalog/`, not `modelhub/`. Moving a type *up* (to a layer that imports it) is wrong; moving *down* (to the layer that owns it) restores one-way flow.
- **Side effects that cross layers go through callbacks, not upward imports.** When a Layer-N module needs to trigger a Layer-N+1 effect (catalog/download wants modelhub to write a manifest; data/ingest wants wiki to re-cluster after a sync), expose a `Callable` parameter (`on_complete=`, `on_indexed=`) and let the higher layer pass the function in. Layer-N stays unaware of Layer-N+1.
- **No re-export shims when moving symbols.** When `ModelTask` moves from `modelhub/models.py` to `catalog/types.py`, every importer updates in the same commit. Do **not** add `from lilbee.catalog.types import ModelTask` back into `modelhub/models.py` to keep old paths working — that defers the cleanup forever and hides the layering fix.
- **`TYPE_CHECKING` is for circular *annotations* only, not runtime workarounds.** A `TYPE_CHECKING` import that exists because runtime would cause a cycle is a sign the layering is wrong: fix the layer assignment instead of papering over with a string-typed annotation.
- **Mock targets follow the symbol.** When a symbol moves between modules, `grep -rn '@patch("lilbee\.<old.path>"' tests/` must return zero in the same commit. Stale `@patch` targets silently no-op and let tests pass without exercising the real code.

### Configuration & State
- **No mutable module-level globals** — all config lives in the `Config` dataclass singleton (`from lilbee.core.config import cfg`)
- Never duplicate state across modules (e.g. no `store_mod.LANCEDB_DIR` mirroring `cfg.lancedb_dir`)
- Prefer dependency injection (pass values as parameters) over reading globals inside functions
- Access config via `cfg.attribute` (late-bound), never `from lilbee.core.config import SOME_CONSTANT` (early-bound copy)
- **No `getattr(self, "name", default)` for own attributes.** If `_foo` is part of the class's state, declare it in `__init__` with an explicit type (`self._foo: Foo | None = None`) and access it as `self._foo`. The `getattr`-with-string-default pattern hides the contract, breaks type checking, and turns every typo into a silent fallback. Same rule for `getattr(self, "_flag", False)` style flag checks: declare the flag in `__init__`. The pattern is allowed only when reflecting over genuinely dynamic attributes the class doesn't own (e.g. iterating dataclass fields).

### Import Discipline

Default: **every import lives at module top**, ordered stdlib, third-party, local. Function-local imports are the exception and must be justified by one of the three cases below. "Feels like it might be heavy" is not a justification.

**Permitted reasons for a function-local import:**

1. **Circular import.** Module A's top-level already imports module B, and module B needs a symbol from A. Put A's import of B inside the one function in B that needs it, with a comment `# circular: B -> A via <symbol>`.
2. **Heavy third-party lib.** Module-top import takes **>50 ms measured by `python -X importtime`** or loads native libraries. Known-heavy libs in this project: `litellm` (provider SDK fanout), `lancedb` (arrow + datafusion), `kreuzberg` (OCR stack), `gguf` (numpy), `sentence_transformers`, `spacy`, `crawl4ai`, `textual` when imported outside the TUI screen modules. (The local inference engine is the out-of-process `llama-server`, reached over HTTP, so it adds no heavy Python import.) Use importtime before declaring a lib heavy.
3. **CLI startup path.** The import lives inside a Typer command body so `lilbee --help` stays fast. Treat this as a sub-case of (2): the CLI loader stays lean so unused subcommands don't pay for their dependencies.

**Never lazy-import the following:**

- Stdlib modules (`os`, `struct`, `enum`, `io`, `fnmatch`, …) — zero cost.
- Local lilbee modules that don't pull in heavy third-party deps at their own module top (`lilbee.core.config`, `lilbee.app.services`, `lilbee.catalog`, `lilbee.modelhub.models`, `lilbee.modelhub.registry`, …).
- Third-party libs already dragged in transitively by the module's top-level imports — re-importing them later is pure noise.
- Project dependencies added explicitly to `pyproject.toml` that measure under 50 ms (`httpx`, `pydantic`, `tiktoken`, `numpy`, `pillow`, `gguf`, …).

**How to measure before arguing "it's heavy":**

```bash
uv run python -X importtime -c "import <lib>" 2>&1 | tail -5
# the last "self" column in microseconds is the module-top cost
```

If the result is under 50 000 µs, it belongs at the module top.

**Optional imports (libs that may not be installed in every deployment):**

The codebase has a small set of `try: import X except ImportError:` patterns for libraries that ship as opt-in extras. The `is_X_available()` style helper is the documented way to gate downstream code on whether the lib loaded.

| Library | Helper | Extra | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `litellm` | `lilbee.providers.litellm_sdk.litellm_available()` | `lilbee[litellm]` | SDK provider, settings TUI |
| `crawl4ai` | `lilbee.crawler.crawler_available()` | `lilbee[crawler]` | Web crawler |
| `graspologic_native` | `lilbee.retrieval.concepts.nlp.concepts_available()` | `lilbee[graph]` | Concept-graph clustering |
| `lilbee_engine` | resolved in `lilbee.providers.fleet.binary.resolve_engine_tool()` | bundled wheel | The local inference engine binaries (llama-server + llama-swap + gguf-parser) |

Any other `try: import X` should be either added to this table or refactored. CLI command bodies that branch on extras dispatch through these `*_available()` helpers, not via `importlib.import_module(name)`.

Other rules:

- **Never use `importlib.reload`** — it's a sign of bad design. If you need different config in tests, mutate the `cfg` singleton.
- **`TYPE_CHECKING` guards** are the right way to avoid circular imports *only* for type annotations. For runtime use, apply the circular-import rule above.

### Test Fixtures
- **Snapshot/restore pattern** for config isolation:
  ```python
  from dataclasses import fields, replace
  from lilbee.core.config import cfg

  @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
  def isolated_env(tmp_path):
      snapshot = replace(cfg)
      cfg.documents_dir = tmp_path / "documents"
      # ... set test values ...
      yield
      for f in fields(cfg):
          setattr(cfg, f.name, getattr(snapshot, f.name))
  ```
- Never save/restore individual fields manually — snapshot the whole object
- Never touch internal module state (e.g. `store_mod.LANCEDB_DIR`) — only mutate `cfg`

### TUI Rules (Textual)
- **No inline CSS** — screens and modals use `.tcss` files via `CSS_PATH`, not `DEFAULT_CSS` strings. Widgets that don't support `CSS_PATH` may use `DEFAULT_CSS` or load from a file.
- **CSS class/ID sync** — every CSS class or ID in a `.tcss` file must have a matching widget in the `.py` file and vice versa
- **TUI tests use `pilot.press()`** — not `action_*()` method calls. `Button.press()` is acceptable since it's a public widget API, not an action bypass.
- **All user-facing text in `messages.py`** — inline strings in screens and widgets are forbidden
- **Confirmation modals reuse `ConfirmDialog`; never roll a new yes/no screen with `textual.widgets.Button`.** The TUI's two-way pickers (`ConfirmDialog`, `ChatModeToggle`, the catalog grid/list toggle) are all built from focusable `Static` pills with `Binding("enter"/"space", "select")`. They share the project's pill aesthetic and stay readable inside narrow modal panes. The Textual `Button` widget brings chunky framework chrome that fights the rest of the surface and collapses cards / modal headers. If you need a yes/no modal, compose `ConfirmDialog(title, message)`. If you need a custom pill picker, follow the `Static, can_focus=True` + bindings pattern in `widgets/confirm_dialog.py` / `widgets/model_bar.py::ChatModePill`. A new `from textual.widgets import Button` in a screen module is a code-review red flag.

### Tests Before Deletion
- When removing code, first make existing tests pass with the new implementation, then delete redundant tests
- Never delete tests and implementation in the same step

### YAGNI & Simplicity
- Don't add features, abstractions, or config that isn't needed yet
- Three similar lines are better than a premature abstraction
- Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs) — trust internal code
- No backwards-compatibility shims — if something is unused, delete it

### No Back-Compat Scaffolding

Refactors update consumers, not the other way around. lilbee is a beta with no
external pinned consumers; old import paths and old method names disappear the
moment a refactor lands. Anything below is a code smell and must not appear in
review:

- **Private symbols re-exported at `__init__.py`.** If a private helper (`_foo`)
  lives in `pkg/sub.py`, callers (including tests) import it as
  `from lilbee.pkg.sub import _foo`, not through the package facade. The
  `__init__.py` exposes only the genuine public API — everything else stays
  inside its host submodule.
- **Module re-imports inside `__init__.py` purely so test patches still fire.**
  `import time` or `from somewhere import settings` at the top of a package
  `__init__.py` because a test patches `pkg.time` or `pkg.settings` is back-
  compat for stale tests. Update the test to patch where the symbol actually
  lives.
- **Docstrings and comments framed as preservation.** Phrases like
  "preserves the historical X API", "kept for backwards compatibility",
  "legacy mock target", "so existing imports keep working" are warning lights.
  If a comment is justifying the existence of code, the code is probably
  scaffolding and should be deleted, not annotated.
- **Shim modules at old paths after a move.** A `gen.py` file that just re-
  exports from `generation.py` exists only so stale `from lilbee.x.gen import`
  callers keep compiling. Update the callers and delete the shim.
- **`# noqa: F401` blocks on `__init__.py` re-exports.** A correct package
  facade lists its surface in `__all__` and ruff respects that natively. If
  noqa is fighting ruff, the imports are probably scaffolding.
- **Methods or attributes labeled "(for backward compat)" / "Prefer X
  instead".** Delete the legacy alias and update the few internal callers, or
  delete the method entirely if it has no callers. Do not leave a tombstone.

When you refactor: grep every consumer (including tests, MCP tools, CLI
commands, server routes, docs) and update them in the same commit. The old
paths fully disappear; there is no migration window to soften.

### Git & Workflow
- Every change tracked as a beads task (`bd create` → `bd close`)
- Run `make check` before closing any task — it mirrors CI exactly
- Tests, lint, and type checks must pass before closing a task
- CI runs on every push and PR
- **Never git push without explicit user approval** — ask before pushing
- No Co-Authored-By lines in commits
- No "Phase N" numbering in commit messages
- Don't commit specs to repo; `docs/superpowers/` is gitignored
- **Pre-commit checklist**: `make format && make lint && make format-check` before every commit
- **Pre-push checklist**: run full review workflow, verify code compiles, run affected tests. Never push optimistically.
- PR descriptions: short, human-readable, no implementation details or internal names, no test plan sections
- Don't rename branches with open PRs; use `gh pr edit` instead
- Use worktrees for parallel work, separate branches for distinct features
- Never stop to ask "should I keep going?" during multi-phase work. Just finish.
- Fix root causes individually, not downstream choke-point bandaids

### QA Protocol
- **QA must run in a dedicated worktree** — branch drift corrupts runs
- QA sessions: **file bugs as beads issues, don't fix inline**
- Use tmux send-keys for automated QA of TUI features
- Always ask before creating issues, PRs, or anything externally visible

### Cross-Cutting Changes
Changes that add an enum variant, a new role/task slot, or anything else whose
correctness depends on updating multiple parallel dispatch / validation sites.

- **Write-boundary canonicalization beats read-path fallbacks.** When the same
  ref, identifier, or config field can be set through multiple entry points
  (HTTP, CLI, TUI, env vars, TOML, direct `cfg.X = ...`), canonicalize it
  ONCE at the write boundary (pydantic `field_validator(mode="after")`, a
  setter, whatever is the single narrow gate) and return the canonical form.
  Alias fallbacks in resolvers are a code smell: they mean canonicalization
  landed in some places but not others. A non-canonical value works until it
  shows up in a log, UI, or diff and confuses the next reader.
- **Front-load the match-arm and entry-point audit.** Before writing the
  first line, grep every dispatch site for the existing variants (`grep -rn
  "ModelTask\.\|ModelRole\.\|SomeEnum\." src/ tests/`). List every
  switch/if-chain/dict. Decide per-site whether it needs the new variant.
  Update every site in the SAME commit that introduces the variant. Leaving
  dispatch sites for reviewers to catch in round N means round N+1 is
  cleaning up regressions from round N's partial fix.
- **Capability / supports_X functions must be role-aware from commit 1.** A
  `get_capabilities(model)` that returns the same default for every input
  (`["completion"]`, `True`) leaks cross-role models into the wrong surfaces.
  Start with role-specific output derived from the catalog entry's task.
  Don't ship the non-role-aware version and wait for a reviewer to flag it.
- **Defaults must round-trip through the tightened validator.** When a
  validator rejects previously-accepted inputs, update the config defaults
  to values that pass under the new rules in the same commit. Otherwise the
  first `Config()` construction raises. Test: `assert Config().X == expected`
  under the new validator.

### Code Review Standards
- **Low complexity** — max ~3 branches per function, extract helpers when exceeded
- **DRY** — reusable shared logic, no copy-paste
- **No private API leaks** — underscore-prefixed functions/attrs stay internal to their module
- **Pythonic idioms** — comprehensions, context managers, dataclasses, protocols over inheritance
- **Named types over inline dicts** — any repeated dict shape should be a dataclass or TypedDict
- **Minimal changes** — make smallest possible edit, don't rewrite large blocks for small fixes
- **Exhaustive review** — multiple review passes until no new findings emerge
- **Compile before test** — verify code compiles before running tests
- **Separate architecture changes from hygiene sweeps.** Mixing a docstring /
  comment cleanup with a semantic refactor makes review hard: reviewers can't
  tell "trimmed docstring" from "removed important rationale." Keep hygiene
  sweeps to their own commit at the end of a series, after architecture is
  frozen.

### Code-Smell Triggers (PR review must flag)
Each of these is a fast-grep that surfaces the patterns we've burned cycles
on in past reviews. A reviewer (and the author, before requesting review)
runs them. A non-empty result is either fixed or has a written justification
in the PR body.

A subset is enforced automatically: `scripts/check_style_rules.py` (run by
`make lint`) fails when a line ADDED in `src/` vs `main` introduces a
getattr-by-name, getattr-with-default, owned-attribute `type: ignore`,
`isinstance(self.app, LilbeeApp)`, string-typed closed set, or module-level
`global`. It scopes to added lines so pre-existing hits don't block unrelated
work; the greps below remain the full set a reviewer still runs by eye.

- `grep -rnE "isinstance\(self\.app, LilbeeApp\)" src/` — production host-narrowing for tests. Fix via `app: LilbeeApp` declaration + LilbeeAppHost in tests.
- `grep -rn "getattr(self, \"" src/` — getattr-by-name for owned attributes. Declare in `__init__`.
- `grep -rn "getattr(.*, \".*\", " src/ | grep -v "__"` — getattr-with-default on dataclass / object fields. If union member doesn't have the field, tighten the type instead of papering with the default.
- `grep -rn "# type: ignore\[attr-defined\]" src/` — owned-attribute ignore. Declare the attribute on the class.
- `grep -rn "# type: ignore\[arg-type\]\|cast(.*self\.app" src/` — host-cast paper trail; same fix as the isinstance rule above.
- `grep -rnE "\b(task|kind|role|event_type|status|mode): str\b" src/` — string-typed closed sets. Convert to StrEnum.
- `grep -rn "\.fn\._\|fn\._lilbee\|fn\._marker" src/` — `fn._attr = True` decorator marking. Use a module-level registry set + `is_marked(fn)` predicate.
- `grep -rn "isinstance(.*, FrontierCatalogRow)\|isinstance(.*, LocalCatalogRow)" src/` — dispatch on a sealed-union variant. Use the `.kind` Literal discriminator.
- `grep -rn "App\[None\]\|class _PlainApp\b\|class _BareApp\b" tests/` — test host that bypasses LilbeeApp. Migrate to LilbeeAppHost.
- `grep -cE "isinstance\(.*widget, (Input|Checkbox|Select|TextArea)\)" src/` followed by "if more than one site" — type-keyed widget routing. Replace with a `dict[type, Callable]`.
- `grep -rnE "^\s*global \w+" src/` — module-level mutable globals. Encapsulate on a class.
- `for f in $(git diff --name-only main -- 'src/**/*.py'); do awk 'NR>1 && /^[A-Z_]+ *[:=]/ && seen {print FILENAME": "$0} /^(def |class )/{seen=1}' "$f"; done` — module-level constant assigned AFTER the first `def`/`class` (the scatter smell). Hoist it into the constants band at the top. See the canonical-module-layout rule in Code Style.
- `grep -rnE "def \w+\(.*\) -> .*:\s*$" src/ | xargs -I{} awk 'def_lines>20'` (proxy: scan modules >700 LOC) — functions over ~20 lines need a split into named sub-helpers.
- `grep -rn "from lilbee\.\(modelhub\|providers\|data\|retrieval\|wiki\|crawler\)" src/lilbee/catalog src/lilbee/core` — upward imports from foundation layers. catalog and core never import from anything above them.
- `grep -rn "from lilbee\.\(retrieval\|wiki\|crawler\|cli\|server\)" src/lilbee/data src/lilbee/modelhub src/lilbee/providers` — Layer-2 modules importing Layer-3+. Invert via callback or move the helper down.

### Self-Review Checklist (before every push)
Run this mentally or explicitly before claiming work is done:
1. **Trace consumers** — for every changed file, grep for who imports it. Go 2-3 levels deep for shared modules (types, constants, config).
2. **Constants vs raw strings** — grep globally for the raw value of any new constant. Every occurrence must use the constant.
3. **CSS sync** — every class/ID in `.tcss` has a matching widget in `.py` and vice versa.
4. **Mock signatures** — after any refactor, verify test patches target the correct module path (patch where imported, not where defined). When hoisting an import between module-top and function-local, grep `@patch("...{Symbol}")` decorators for that symbol and update them in the same commit. Stale patch targets mean the mock never fires and tests pass without exercising the path — the single worst review-cycle-burner in a refactor.
5. **Dead code** — removed/renamed functions have no remaining references. No orphaned imports.
6. **Test coverage** — every new code path has a test with meaningful assertions. No untested branches.
7. **Type changes** — field added/removed? All constructors, factories, serializers updated?
8. **Export changes** — new export actually needed? Removed export has no dangling imports?
9. **No back-compat scaffolding** — `grep -rni "historical\|backwards compat\|legacy mock\|preserves the.*api\|so existing imports keep working\|for backward compat" src/ tests/`. Every hit is either real legacy data-migration code (allowed) or refactor scaffolding (delete). If a comment justifies the existence of code, the code is probably the scaffolding.
10. **No new test-aware production branches** — `grep -rnE "isinstance\(self\.app, LilbeeApp\)\|test apps aren't" src/` must return zero new sites in your diff. The escape hatch was rip-and-replaced; new occurrences are regressions.
11. **No new owned-attribute reflection** — `git diff` for added `getattr(self, "X"` and `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` lines. Each must have a written justification in the PR body or be removed.
12. **Run the Code-Smell Triggers section grep set** — every entry above. Compare counts vs `main`. The number must not increase.

### Behavior Learning (floop)
- `floop` captures corrections and learned behaviors across sessions
- Hooks run automatically via `~/.claude/settings.json` (session-start, dynamic-context, detect-correction)
- `floop active` — show behaviors active in current context
- `floop learn` — manually capture a correction/behavior
- `floop list` — list all learned behaviors
- `floop prompt` — generate prompt section from active behaviors

## Agent Integration

lilbee has a local knowledge base you can query. Use it for domain-specific questions about the user's documents.

### MCP Server (recommended)

An MCP server is configured in `.claude/settings.json` for this project. Tools available:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search(query, top_k)` | Search for relevant chunks |
| `status()` | Show indexed docs and config |
| `sync()` | Sync documents to vector store |
| `add(paths, force, vision_model)` | Add files/dirs and sync |
| `init(path)` | Initialize a local `.lilbee/` knowledge base |
| `reset(confirm)` | Delete all documents and data (factory reset, requires confirm=true) |

Prefer `search` -- it returns pre-embedded chunks without calling the LLM at query time.

### JSON CLI (fallback)

All commands accept `--json` (before the subcommand) for structured output:

```bash
lilbee --json search "query" --top-k 5
lilbee --json status
lilbee --json sync
```

Every command returns a single JSON object on stdout. Errors return non-zero exit + `{"error": "message"}`.

### Opencode integration

opencode is the supported agent integration today. `lilbee launch opencode` is the fast path. Pull chat models via the TUI catalog first (`lilbee` -> `/models`). `lilbee agent-config opencode` prints the same config block without launching. `lilbee serve` exposes `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions` directly for anything custom.

See the [`lilbee-mcp` skill](docs/agent-skills/lilbee-mcp/SKILL.md) for the full MCP reference and the JSON CLI fallback for non-MCP agents.

## Wiki Conventions

lilbee's wiki layer is modelled after Karpathy's LLM Wiki: concept and
entity pages that compound across sources rather than one page per
document. The layout under `$data_root/$wiki_dir/` is:

```
concepts/    one page per LLM-curated concept from the source (e.g. braking-systems.md)
entities/    one page per proper-noun entity (e.g. henry-ford.md)
summaries/   legacy per-source pages (still supported, not the default)
synthesis/   cross-source pages produced by `wiki synthesize`
drafts/      low-faithfulness drafts, drift drafts, and PENDING markers
             (parse-failure or slug-collision) surfaced via `wiki drafts list`
archive/     pages retired by `wiki prune` (plus the one-time Phase D
             migration archive at `archive/concepts/` from the pre-Phase-D
             noun-chunk generator)
index.md     auto-generated table of contents, grouped by page type
log.md       append-only audit trail (## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] op | details)
```

**Slugs** are lowercase, hyphen-separated filenames that also double as
the `[[link]]` target (`braking-systems`, not `Braking Systems`). The
slug generator lives at `wiki/shared.py:make_slug`.

**Page lifecycle**. `lilbee wiki build` runs the Phase D migration once
(archives pre-Phase-D noun-chunk concept pages and unwraps stale
`[[concept-slug]]` links), extracts NER entities from the chunk store
via `cfg.wiki_entity_mode` (default `ner_entities`: spaCy NER only),
and then per source issues one batched LLM call that both identifies
3–5 concepts worth a wiki page AND writes a section for each identified
concept plus each extracted entity. Sections are split, citation-verified
per section against the shared chunk pool, embedding-faithfulness scored
(`wiki/gen.py:_check_faithfulness`, cosine of body vs mean chunk vector,
threshold `cfg.wiki_embedding_faithfulness_threshold`), and written to
`concepts/` or `entities/`. Sections that fail to parse become PENDING
markers in `drafts/` that the user resolves via `wiki drafts accept/reject`.
`lilbee sync` runs `_incremental_wiki_update` afterward with
`extract_concepts=False` so incremental re-ingest never churns concept
slugs; the cap is `cfg.wiki_ingest_update_cap` (default 20).

**Retrieval inside wiki/gen.py**. Each page is grounded in the top
`cfg.wiki_concept_max_chunks_per_page` chunks returned by the store's
hybrid search, optionally reordered by the native GGUF reranker when
`cfg.reranker_model` is set. Every path respects
`cfg.diversity_max_per_source` so one loud document can't monopolize a
topic page.

**`[[wiki links]]`**. After each build, `wiki/links.py:rewrite_wiki_links`
rewrites plain-text slug surface forms to Obsidian `[[slug]]` links
in the page body, skipping YAML frontmatter, code fences, and the
auto-generated citation block. The graph view in Obsidian is the point;
orphan detection in `lilbee wiki lint` flags concept or entity pages
with zero inbound `[[links]]`.

**Adding a new entity-extraction strategy**. Implement
`EntityExtractor` from `wiki/entity_extractor/base.py`, add a new
`WikiEntityMode` enum value in `config.py`, wire it into
`wiki/entity_extractor/factory.py:_EXTRACTOR_BY_MODE`, and extend the
`wiki_entity_mode` entry in `cli/settings_map.py` (its `choices` field
reads from the enum, so no update needed there).

**Adding a new config knob**. All wiki settings live under the `Wiki`
group in `config.py` and `cli/settings_map.py`. Prefix with `wiki_`
(for module-level behaviour) or `wiki_concept_` / `wiki_entity_`
(for strategy-scoped knobs). Use `ConfigField(writable=True)` so the
setting appears in `/settings`, the HTTP `/set` route, and
`LILBEE_*` env vars.

**Writing to log.md**. Use `append_wiki_log(action, details)` from
`wiki/index.py` with one of the `WIKI_LOG_ACTION_*` constants in
`wiki/shared.py` (`BUILD`, `INGEST`, `LINT`, `GENERATED`).
Don't hand-roll timestamps; the helper writes
`## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] action | details` so `grep '## \['` still
surfaces every entry.
