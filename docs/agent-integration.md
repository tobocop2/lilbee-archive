# Agent Integration

lilbee serves as a local retrieval backend for AI coding agents. Two entry
points are available: MCP (recommended) and JSON CLI.

## Tool calling: supported model families

When you point an agent at a lilbee-hosted local model (via `lilbee launch
opencode` or the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint), lilbee
extracts structured `tool_calls` from the model's text output for the
following families. Detection is by chat-template marker, so any model in
each family with the standard markers is covered:

| Family | Detection signal | Example models |
|---|---|---|
| **Qwen3 / Qwen2.5** | `<tool_call>`, `</tool_call>` | Qwen3 (every size), Qwen2.5-Instruct |
| **Qwen3-Coder** | `<function=`, `<parameter=` | Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B |
| **Mistral** | `[TOOL_CALLS]` | Mistral 7B Instruct, Mistral Small, Mistral Nemo, Mixtral, Ministral |
| **Gemma 4** | `<\|"\|>` | Gemma 4 |
| **Cohere Command** | `<\|START_ACTION\|>` | Cohere Command R / R+ / R7B |
| **ERNIE** | `<\|begin_of_sentence\|>`, `<\|end_of_sentence\|>` | Baidu ERNIE 4.5 |
| **GPT-OSS** | `<\|channel\|>`, `<\|call\|>` | OpenAI gpt-oss-20b, gpt-oss-120b |
| **SmolLM3** | `<tool_call>` + arch `smollm3` | HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3 |
| **Hermes** | `"You are a function calling AI model"` | Nous Hermes 2 Pro / Hermes 3 |
| **DeepSeek V3.1** | `<｜tool▁calls▁begin｜>` (fullwidth) | DeepSeek-V3.1 |
| **IBM Granite** | `<\|start_of_role\|>` | Granite 3.x Instruct |
| **Phi-4 mini** | `<\|tool\|>`, `<\|/tool\|>` | Microsoft Phi-4-mini-instruct |
| **Functionary v3** | `>>>all` literal | meetkai/functionary-medium-v3.2 |
| **Llama 3.x** | `<\|python_tag\|>` | Llama 3.1 / 3.2 / 3.3 Instruct |
| **GLM 4.5 / 4.6** | `<arg_key>`, `<arg_value>` | zai-org GLM-4.5, GLM-4.6 |
| **GLM 4.7** | single-line `<tool_call>...<arg_key>` | zai-org GLM-4.7 |
| **Kimi K2** | `<\|tool_calls_section_begin\|>` | moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct |
| **InternLM2** | GGUF architecture `internlm2` | InternLM2 / InternLM2.5 chat |
| **OLMo 3** | `<function_calls>...</function_calls>` | AI2 OLMo 3 Instruct |
| **LFM2** | `<\|tool_list_start\|>` | Liquid AI LFM2 |

20 families. Models outside this set fall through to no extraction: the
raw tool-call markup arrives as plain text in `message.content`, the
client doesn't invoke the tool, and a warning is logged on the first
such request. The list is updated periodically as new families are
released and their formats land in the upstream sources we track
(HuggingFace transformers test fixtures, vLLM tool parsers). Current
schemas live at
[`src/lilbee/providers/worker/response_parser/schemas/`](../src/lilbee/providers/worker/response_parser/schemas/).

A schema-retirement watcher checks weekly whether upstream HF model
repos have populated `response_schema` in their `tokenizer_config.json`
(the documented public API for tool-call parsing in transformers). When
a repo catches up, the workflow opens an issue with the deletion
checklist for that family; lilbee retires the local copy and the
extraction routes through `tokenizer.parse_response()` instead.

The longer-term direction is to retire per-family schemas entirely
once llama.cpp's runtime chat-template autoparser becomes reachable
from Python; see `docs/architecture.md` for the design and the
tracking bead.

## Fastest start: have the agent configure lilbee for you

The shortest path from "fresh install" to "useful lilbee" is to hand the
setup to an MCP-aware agent. It can pick models for your hardware, pull
them, wire them into the embedding / reranker / vision roles, and tune
retrieval for the kind of questions you actually want to ask. See
[Fine-tuning lilbee from your agent](#fine-tuning-lilbee-from-your-agent)
below for the canonical example prompt.

## MCP Server (recommended)

`lilbee mcp` launches an MCP server that agents call directly as tools. No
shell-out needed.

### Setup

Add to your MCP client's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lilbee": {
      "command": "lilbee",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For opencode, an `opencode.json` in the project root works too. This one denies the
built-in search tools so the agent has to use lilbee, and allows the `task` tool so it can
delegate long ops to a subagent:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "codesearch": "deny",
    "websearch": "deny",
    "webfetch": "deny",
    "read": "allow",
    "write": "allow",
    "edit": "allow",
    "bash": "allow",
    "glob": "allow",
    "grep": "allow",
    "list": "allow",
    "task": "allow",
    "lilbee_*": "allow"
  },
  "mcp": {
    "lilbee": { "type": "local", "command": ["lilbee", "mcp"] }
  }
}
```

### Drop-in agent files

For a project where you want the agent to use lilbee reliably, copy three things in:

1. An `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) that names lilbee as the retrieval backend, lists the
   citation rule, and says long ops go to a worker subagent. The lilbee repo ships a copy at
   [`demos/AGENTS.md`](../demos/AGENTS.md).
2. A `lilbee-worker` subagent that handles `lilbee_add` / `lilbee_sync` / `lilbee_crawl` /
   `lilbee_model_pull`. Copy from
   [`demos/.opencode/agents/lilbee-worker.md`](../demos/.opencode/agents/lilbee-worker.md).
3. The [`lilbee-mcp` skill](../src/lilbee/skills/lilbee_mcp/SKILL.md) (opencode / Claude
   Skill format), copied into `.opencode/skills/lilbee-mcp/` or
   `.claude/skills/lilbee-mcp/`. A single `SKILL.md` that documents every lilbee
   MCP tool with a quick-vs-long split, so the agent knows which calls block and
   which don't.

### Tools

| Tool | Description | Requires LLM backend |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `search(query, top_k, scope)` | Retrieve relevant chunks. Omitting `top_k` falls back to `cfg.top_k` so `settings_set` governs candidate count. `scope` is `"raw"` (source docs), `"wiki"` (wiki pages), or `"both"` (default) | No (uses pre-computed embeddings) |
| `status()` | Show indexed documents, config, and chunk counts | No |
| `sync()` | Sync the documents directory into the vector store | Yes (for embedding) |
| `add(paths, force, enable_ocr, ocr_timeout)` | Add files, directories, or URLs and index them | Yes (for embedding) |
| `crawl(url, depth, max_pages)` | Start a non-blocking crawl. Returns a `task_id` for polling | No (crawl only; sync separately) |
| `crawl_status(task_id)` | Check a running crawl's progress, errors, and completion | No |
| `init(path)` | Create a local `.lilbee/` in the given directory | No |
| `remove(names, delete_files)` | Remove documents from the index (optionally delete sources) | No |
| `list_documents()` | List all indexed documents with chunk counts | No |
| `reset(confirm)` | Delete all documents and data (factory reset; pass `confirm=true`) | No |
| `model_list(source, task)` | List installed models, optionally filtered by source or role | No |
| `model_show(model)` | Show catalog + installed metadata for a model ref | No |
| `model_pull(model, source)` | Download a model, streaming progress via MCP notifications | Yes (download) |
| `model_rm(model, source)` | Remove an installed model | No |
| `catalog_browse(task, search, size, installed, featured, sort, limit, offset)` | Browse the lilbee model catalog (curated + Hugging Face) so the agent can pick what to pull | No |
| `settings_list(group)` | List every writable setting with value, default, type, help text, choices, and `reindex_required` | No |
| `settings_get(key)` | Get one setting's current value and metadata | No |
| `settings_set(updates)` | Atomically update a batch of writable settings; validates, persists, and invalidates the in-process model and provider caches | No |
| `settings_reset(keys)` | Reset writable settings to their built-in defaults | No |

A separate, experimental `wiki_*` family is documented at the end of this page.

### Example responses

**`search("oil change interval", top_k=3)`**

```json
[
  {"source": "manual.pdf", "chunk": "Change oil every 5,000 miles...", "distance": 0.23, "chunk_type": "raw"}
]
```

**`status()`**

```json
{
  "config": {"documents_dir": "...", "chat_model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF/Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M.gguf", "embedding_model": "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.Q4_K_M.gguf", "reranker_model": "", "enable_ocr": false},
  "sources": [{"filename": "manual.pdf", "chunk_count": 42}],
  "total_chunks": 42
}
```

## API keys never come back over MCP

API-key fields (and `hf_token`) carry a `write_only` flag on the
config. `settings_set` still accepts writes, but `settings_list`
skips them and `settings_get` errors. Secrets do not round-trip.

## Fine-tuning lilbee from your agent

Drop this into any MCP-aware agent:

> I'm going to index `~/projects/my-stack/` with lilbee and ask
> questions about how the auth layer is wired and which functions call
> which. Assess my hardware, recommend embedding / reranker / vision
> models, pull them in the background, then adapt the lilbee defaults
> for this library and question style.

The agent answers the questions itself, so it only touches model roles
that affect retrieval (`embedding_model`, `reranker_model`,
`vision_model`). The `chat_model` slot is for the human's later TUI use.

Typical flow: `lilbee_status` + `lilbee_settings_list` to see baseline,
`lilbee_catalog_browse(task=...)` to pick models per role, `lilbee_model_pull`
via the `lilbee-worker` subagent, one batched `lilbee_settings_set` to wire
the models and tune retrieval (raise `top_k` / `diversity_max_per_source`
for code-heavy libraries; enable `concept_graph`; lower `chunk_size`).
If the result includes `reindex_required: true`, the agent should hand
`lilbee_sync(force_rebuild=true)` to the worker.

## JSON CLI

Every command accepts `--json` (or `-j`) before the subcommand for structured output. Use this when MCP isn't available or when the agent needs to shell out.

### Two modes

- **`search`.** Raw chunk retrieval. No LLM call at query time. Use when your agent has its own LLM and just needs relevant chunks.
- **`ask`.** Full local RAG via llama-cpp (or the SDK backend when installed). Use for fully-local workflows.

### Commands

```bash
# Retrieve chunks (no LLM call at query time)
lilbee --json search "query" --top-k 5
# {"command": "search", "query": "...", "results": [...]}

# Ask a question with local RAG
lilbee --json ask "question"
# {"command": "ask", "question": "...", "answer": "...", "sources": [...]}

# Check what's indexed
lilbee --json status
# {"command": "status", "config": {...}, "sources": [...], "total_chunks": N}

# Trigger document sync
lilbee --json sync
# {"command": "sync", "added": [...], "updated": [...], "removed": [...]}
```

### JSON output format

Every command returns a single JSON object on stdout. Errors return non-zero exit + `{"error": "message"}`. Results include `distance` scores (lower = more relevant). Vectors are stripped from output.

## REST API

The built-in HTTP server (`lilbee serve`) exposes a full REST API. Streaming endpoints use Server-Sent Events (SSE). See the [REST API reference](https://lilbee.sh/api/) for the complete OpenAPI schema and [the usage guide](usage.md#http-server) for invocation options.

### Crawl endpoint

`POST /api/crawl` streams SSE progress events while crawling a URL:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7433/api/crawl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "depth": 1, "max_pages": 50}'
```

SSE events emitted: `crawl_start`, `crawl_page`, `crawl_done`, then `done` (or `error` on failure).

## Recommendations

- Prefer `search` over `ask` if your agent has its own LLM. It's faster and skips the LLM call at query time.
- Use MCP when available. It's more direct than shelling out.
- Run `status` / `status()` first to confirm the right index is active.
- Run `sync` / `sync()` after adding documents to refresh the index.
- An LLM backend is needed for: (1) embedding during sync/indexing, (2) `ask` for answers, (3) wiki generation, (4) `model_pull`. Once indexed, `search` works without an LLM. By default, llama-cpp handles everything locally. Install `lilbee[litellm]` to route through external backends like Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini.

## Experimental: wiki tools

The wiki layer is opt-in and still rough. The build / read tools
(`wiki_list`, `wiki_read`, `wiki_build`, `wiki_update`, `wiki_synthesize`)
return `{"error": "wiki not enabled"}` until the user runs
`settings_set({"wiki": true})`. The remaining wiki tools work against
the on-disk wiki directory regardless of the flag and report empty
results when there's nothing to read. Skip everything here unless the
user explicitly asks about wiki / synthesis pages.

| Tool | Description | Requires LLM backend |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `wiki_status()` | Page counts, generator settings, last build timestamp, `wiki_enabled` flag | No |
| `wiki_list()` | List all wiki pages grouped by type | No |
| `wiki_read(slug)` | Return the body and metadata of a single wiki page | No |
| `wiki_build()` | Generate the full topic / entity wiki from the indexed library | Yes (LLM) |
| `wiki_update()` | Refresh the wiki after a sync (currently a full rebuild) | Yes (LLM) |
| `wiki_synthesize()` | Generate cross-source synthesis pages into `synthesis/` | Yes (LLM) |
| `wiki_lint(wiki_source)` | Find orphan pages, stale links, and pending drafts | No |
| `wiki_citations(wiki_source)` | Return per-section citation coverage for a source | No |
| `wiki_drafts_list()` | List pending drafts with drift, faithfulness, and pairing info | No |
| `wiki_drafts_diff(slug)` | Show the diff between a pending draft and the live page | No |
| `wiki_prune()` | Move stale wiki pages to `archive/` | No |

**`wiki_list()` example response**

```json
{
  "concepts": [{"slug": "braking-systems", "sources": 5}],
  "entities": [{"slug": "henry-ford", "sources": 3}],
  "drafts": [{"slug": "tire-pressure", "reason": "low_faithfulness"}]
}
```

Query a built wiki via `search(..., scope="wiki")`.
