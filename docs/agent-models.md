# Local models for coding agents

`lilbee launch opencode`, `lilbee launch hermes`, and `lilbee launch claude` wire [opencode](https://opencode.ai), [hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) to your local lilbee chat models, so an agent searches your library, reads the results, and answers with citations, all on your machine. opencode and hermes talk to lilbee over the OpenAI-compatible API; Claude Code talks over the Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` route. All three call `lilbee_search` through MCP, so a model works here only if it emits tool calls in a format lilbee can read.

Launch with `--no-mcp` to keep lilbee as the model provider but drop its MCP block, leaving your own agent MCP config untouched. The default is the `agent_mcp_enabled` config field (env `LILBEE_AGENT_MCP_ENABLED`); `--mcp` / `--no-mcp` override it per launch.

Claude Code needs a large context window: its built-in system prompt and tool schemas take tens of thousands of tokens before the first turn. Pick a chat model that serves a 64K-token window or larger (the launcher warns when the served window is smaller). `lilbee launch claude` keeps the session lean -- it loads only project-scoped settings and only lilbee's MCP server -- because a populated global Claude Code setup adds tens of thousands more tokens that no local window absorbs.

The first prompt on a large model pays a long prompt-processing (prefill) delay after the launcher's warm bar finishes. An agent's first turn is ~32K tokens, and on a 100B-class model that is 30 seconds to a few minutes of compute before the first visible token; the agent shows only its spinner during it. The wait is roughly the prompt size over the model's prefill speed, and it is work, not a hang: poll `GET /api/health` and watch `chat_prefill_processed` climb toward `chat_prefill_total`. Later turns reuse the prompt cache and start far faster.

## Verified families

Each family completes the loop end to end: the agent sends a prompt, the model calls `lilbee_search`, the tool runs against an indexed workspace, and the model answers from the results. How reliably a model reaches for a tool depends on the model and its size, not on lilbee.

| Family | Example model | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Qwen3 | `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-GGUF` | |
| Qwen3-Coder | `unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF` | sparse-MoE coder variant |
| Llama 3.1 | `bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF` | |
| Hermes 3 | `bartowski/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B-GGUF` | |
| Mistral-Nemo | `bartowski/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-GGUF` | |
| Gemma | `unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF` | |
| SmolLM3 | `bartowski/HuggingFaceTB_SmolLM3-3B-GGUF` | |
| Cohere Command-R7B | `bartowski/c4ai-command-r7b-12-2024-GGUF` | renders from the HF tokenizer's template; needs the GGUF's wrong 8192 context corrected to the real 128K |
| gpt-oss | `ggml-org/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF` | Harmony tool-call format; the 120B is split across shards and needs a >80 GB GPU |
| GLM-4.5-Air | `unsloth/GLM-4.5-Air-GGUF` | renders from the HF tokenizer's template; split GGUF, needs a >80 GB GPU |

## Not yet supported

These don't work today, because of the model or the bundled runtime, not lilbee's tool plumbing.

| Family | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Functionary v3 | dispatches now that lilbee renders from the HF tokenizer's tool template, but multi-turn is still inconsistent |
| OLMo-3 | the tool-trained Olmo-3-7B-Instruct still describes the call in prose instead of emitting a structured one |
| InternLM2.5 | describes the search it would run instead of emitting a tool call |
| DeepSeek R1-Distill (Qwen, Llama) | reasoning distills that aren't tool-trained; they describe the search inside their reasoning instead of emitting a tool call |
| Phi-4-mini | the bundled llama.cpp aborts (SIGABRT) building the compute graph for this architecture |
| GLM-4-9B-chat | the bundled llama.cpp aborts (SIGABRT) loading this GGUF |
| ERNIE-4.5 0.3B, LFM2 1.2B | too small to call tools reliably |

## The QA harness

`tools/qa/opencode/` drives the real opencode binary against a real `lilbee serve`, one family at a time. Nothing is mocked: a pass means the whole path (serve, `/v1/chat/completions`, tool-call extraction, MCP `lilbee_search`, grounded answer) works for that model. Tool-calling is agent-agnostic, so a verified family behaves the same under hermes.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `matrix.py` | Driver. Defines the matrix (`models.toml`), runs each cell, writes `results/results.md`. |
| `models.toml` | One row per family with its GGUF ref and tier. |
| `prevalidate.py` | Optional pre-flight: assert each model answers well before an expensive run. |
| `stress.py` | Concurrency probe: many agents hitting one served model at once. |
| `results/` | Per-run output: `results.md` plus each cell's captured agent pane. |

### Per-cell lifecycle (`run_cell`)

1. **Setup**: pull the GGUF, write a per-cell workspace (a small indexed corpus plus an `AGENTS.md` directing the agent to use `lilbee_search`), scope the agent's built-in tools off, pin the model, boot `lilbee serve`, and index the corpus.
2. **Drive**: launch the agent in a dedicated tmux session, type the tier's scenario prompt, and poll the pane.
3. **Judge**: apply the PASS gate against the pane and the server log.
4. **Capture**: save the full agent pane to `results/<family>.pane.txt`.
5. **Teardown**: kill the session and the serve, scrape worker/dispatch errors from `launcher-serve.log`, delete the GGUF unless `--keep-models`.

### The PASS gate

A cell passes only when **both** hold, so a model that narrates a tool call as plain text cannot pass:

- the `⚙ lilbee_search` dispatch glyph appears in the agent pane, **and**
- a fresh delta of **>= 2** `POST /v1/chat/completions 200` lines in the server log (the tool turn plus its follow-up answer; 1 is prose-only).

A clean run also requires no worker/dispatch errors in `launcher-serve.log`.

### Memory and host notes

The harness is tuned for an 80GB+ GPU pod. On a memory-constrained host (e.g. a 32GB Apple Silicon laptop) a giant may not fit: the fleet refuses to load a model that exceeds free system RAM rather than freezing the machine (see `providers/fleet/planning.py`), so an oversize cell surfaces a clean error. `LILBEE_QA_NUM_CTX` pins a smaller context when needed.
