# Shared Engine Load and Stability Benchmarks

Throughput, latency, and crash-recovery results for the shared inference
engine: one llama.cpp fleet serving every lilbee process on the machine.

## Test Setup

- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Hardware:** NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe (driver 570.195.03), RunPod secure cloud
- **Software:** lilbee 0.6.9 (branch `fix/serve-data-dir-singleton`), engine pin
  `llama-cpp-0.3.30+swap-v223+gguf-v0.25.0`, Python 3.11.10
- **Chat model:** Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, Q8_0 GGUF (37 GB weights), 4 batching slots,
  65,536 tokens of context per slot (262,144 served), q8_0 KV cache, flash
  attention on. This is a sparse mixture-of-experts model: it occupies VRAM
  like a 35B model but activates about 3B parameters per token, so its decode
  rate is far higher than a dense model of the same footprint. Read the
  throughput numbers below as specific to that architecture, not as a general
  35B result.
- **Embed model:** nomic-embed-text-v1.5, Q4_K_M

The harness lives in `tools/qa/shared-engine/load/`: `bench_setup.sh` provisions
the pod, `bench_sweep.sh` runs the concurrency sweep (llmperf against lilbee's
`/v1`, then against the engine's llama-swap proxy directly so the server overhead
is a measured delta), and `soak_run.sh` runs the chaos soak. The per-cell
summaries those runs produced are recorded under
`docs/benchmarks/shared-engine-load-results/`.

## Throughput sweep

32 streamed chat completions per cell (16 at c=1), 200 generated tokens each,
against lilbee's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`. Token counts include
reasoning deltas (Qwen3.6 is a thinking model). TTFT is time to first streamed
token; per-stream throughput is each request's own decode rate.

| Concurrent streams | tok/s per stream (p50) | TTFT p50 | TTFT p95 | Aggregate tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 130.9 | 0.11 s | 0.12 s | 120 |
| 2 | 108.8 | 0.25 s | 0.36 s | 188 |
| 4 | 70.2 | 0.57 s | 0.72 s | 231 |
| 8 | 70.2 | 3.97 s | 4.06 s | 235 |
| 16 | 70.3 | 10.90 s | 11.06 s | 230 |

Reading the shape: 1 to 4 streams share the server's 4 batching slots, so each
stream keeps a real interactive rate while aggregate throughput climbs. Past 4
streams the extra requests queue (TTFT grows linearly) while per-stream and
aggregate rates hold flat, which is the correct saturation behavior rather than
collapse.

A repeat of the c=1 cell at the end of the sweep (the drift control) measured
130.8 tok/s against 130.9 at the start, so the box did not degrade during the
run.

## Server overhead

The same driver pointed directly at the engine's llama-swap proxy, bypassing
lilbee's server entirely:

| Path | tok/s per stream (p50) | TTFT p50 |
|---|---|---|
| Bare engine (llama-swap direct), c=1 | 130.8 | 0.115 s |
| Through lilbee serve, c=1 | 130.9 | 0.114 s |
| Bare engine, c=4 | 69.9 | 0.567 s |
| Through lilbee serve, c=4 | 70.2 | 0.573 s |

lilbee's routing layer adds no measurable throughput cost and about a
millisecond of TTFT: the deltas at both concurrency levels are inside
run-to-run noise.

## Chaos soak

Rounds of 4 concurrent chat completions plus one CLI engine acquire/release
cycle. Every 5th round, at a random moment, one engine process (a llama-server
or the llama-swap proxy itself) is SIGKILLed. Per-round invariants: all streams
and the CLI succeed, VRAM stays within 10% of the round-1 baseline, process
counts return to baseline, and the engine-membership lock count never grows.

**40 rounds, 8 forced kills, zero invariant breaches.** Every round completed
4/4 streams green, including the chaos rounds themselves; a proxy kill costs
one slower round (about 35 s, the in-place rebuild) and full service resumes
the next round. VRAM stayed pinned at 39.4 GB across the entire run, and the
membership lock count never left 1.

The first execution of this soak, on a build without commit `4a43e0c9`, is why
that commit exists: killing the llama-swap proxy orphaned its VRAM, doubled
GPU memory by building a duplicate engine in the overflow slot, and left the
resident server returning errors until restart. The soak now passes the same
violence cleanly, which is the point of running it.

## Endurance run

The same soak at 600 rounds: **2 hours 24 minutes of continuous load, 2,400
chat completions across 4 concurrent streams, 600 CLI engine cycles, and 120
forced process kills.**

- Zero persistent failures and zero resource leaks: VRAM held between 39.4 and
  39.9 GB for the entire run, the membership lock count never left 1, and
  process counts always returned to baseline.
- 588 of 600 rounds fully green. The 12 degraded rounds were the crash-recovery
  window: 10 were the round immediately following a proxy kill (streams fail
  for one 14 to 16 second round while the engine rebuilds in place, then full
  service resumes), and 2 were partial rounds in the same neighborhood.
- The CLI path, a fresh process each cycle, went 600 for 600: an arriving
  process always finds or rebuilds a working engine.

Requests that land inside the rebuild window currently fail fast rather than
waiting out the rebuild; turning that window into added latency instead of
errors is tracked as a follow-up.

## What this does and does not show

These results show the shared-engine architecture holds up under sustained
concurrent multi-client load and survives repeated engine-process crashes
without leaking VRAM, locks, or processes, on one GPU with one model pairing.

Four gaps are worth naming, in order of how much they would move the numbers:

- **One model architecture.** A sparse MoE is the most favorable case for
  decode rate. Small dense, mid dense, and 70B-class dense models are pending.
- **Short prompts.** The sweep sent short prompts and generated 200 tokens, so
  time to first token here reflects queueing, not prefill. Agent workloads send
  tens of thousands of tokens of context, where prefill dominates TTFT.
- **One role under load.** Chat carried the load while embedding stayed idle.
  Real usage runs ingest alongside chat on the same engine, and that contention
  is untested.
- **One card.** No consumer GPU, no Apple Silicon (a different engine backend,
  not merely a slower one), and no multi-GPU placement.

Absolute throughput numbers are specific to this model, quantization, and card.
