# The full reel

Same demos as on [lilbee.sh/](https://lilbee.sh/),
with the captions long-form and a handful of extras that don't fit in the site's
tab list.

The ten that match the site reel, in order:

1. [First run](#first-run)
2. [TUI tour](#tui-tour)
3. [Chat with cited answers](#chat-with-cited-answers)
4. [Add files](#add-files)
5. [Crawl a URL](#crawl-a-url)
6. [Model catalog](#model-catalog)
7. [Settings](#settings)
8. [Agent: code (lilbee talking to lilbee)](#agent-code-lilbee-talking-to-lilbee)
9. [Agent: PDF](#agent-pdf)
10. [Run a model bigger than one card](#run-a-model-bigger-than-one-card)

Extras: [agent: live indexing](#agent-live-indexing), [agent: Godot codegen against the full class reference](#agent-godot-codegen-against-the-full-class-reference), [command surface](#command-surface).

## First run

First-launch wizard. Pick a chat model and an embedding model from the curated list;
both download in parallel and you can keep working while they pull.

## TUI tour

A quick sweep through every screen.

![tour](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobocop2/lilbee/gh-pages/demos/tui-tour.gif)

## Chat with cited answers

Ask the Crown Victoria owner's manual; every answer points back to the page. Inline
`[N]` markers are clickable in mouse-supporting terminals to open a source preview
at the exact spot.

![chat with cited answers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobocop2/lilbee/gh-pages/demos/tui-chat.gif)

## Add files

`/add <path>` copies the file into your library and embeds it. Switching to the Task
Center mid-ingest shows the live progress bar; once it lands you can ask away.

![add and task center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobocop2/lilbee/gh-pages/demos/tui-add.gif)

## Crawl a URL

`/crawl <url>` fetches a page (or a small site) into your library, then you can ask
questions against it with the same cited-answer flow.

![crawl Wikipedia + cited answer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobocop2/lilbee/gh-pages/demos/tui-crawl.gif)

## Model catalog

Browse models from Hugging Face Hub. Cycle the inner tabs (Discover / Chat / Embed /
Vision / Rerank / Library), toggle grid / list, scroll for more, search the picks,
open model info, pull a tiny model live.

![model catalog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobocop2/lilbee/gh-pages/demos/tui-catalog.gif)

## Settings

Tabbed editor for every knob: Models, Ingest, Generation, Retrieval, Display,
Crawling, API-Keys, System.

## Agent: code (lilbee talking to lilbee)

The headline demo of answering from real code. An agent indexes lilbee's own source through lilbee's
MCP server, then answers questions about how lilbee works, citing
`src/lilbee/.../file.py:LINE` for every claim.

## Agent: PDF

The agent finds `cv-manual.pdf` in the project, delegates the index to
`lilbee-worker`, then `lilbee_search`-es and returns a page-cited answer.

## Run a model bigger than one card

A chat model too large for any single GPU is split across as many cards as it
needs. Here lilbee indexes its own source live, then answers "what is lilbee"
and "how does lilbee run a model too big for one GPU", with a 235B model
tensor-split across three A40s and the GPU monitor showing the load alongside.

You can also place each role by hand. The placement editor refuses a layout
that won't fit with the exact shortfall (pinning chat to one 40 GiB card when
it needs 97.5 GiB), then accepts the model spread back across the cards and
answers on the fleet you chose, citing `placement.py`.

## Extras

These don't have a tab on the site, but they're part of the same reel.

### Agent: live indexing

The smaller agent-over-MCP demo. An MCP-aware coding agent indexes a Godot 4
pathfinding subset in a few seconds, then `lilbee_search`-es for `AStarGrid2D` and
answers method-by-method against the local files.

### Agent: Godot codegen against the full class reference

Same shape against a full XML reference library. The agent indexes Godot 4's class
reference (810 XML files, 3449 chunks) via `lilbee-worker`, then `lilbee_search`-es
for `AStarGrid2D`, `TileMap`, `RandomNumberGenerator`, and friends as it writes a
procedural level generator. Every API call is backed by a
`godot-classes/<Class>.xml:line` citation. See
[`docs/benchmarks/godot-level-generator.md`](benchmarks/godot-level-generator.md)
for the side-by-side against a no-RAG baseline (4 hallucinated APIs without
lilbee, 0 with).

### Command surface

`Ctrl+P` opens the Textual command palette; `?` toggles the keybinding cheat
sheet; `/help` opens the searchable slash-command catalog.

![command palette + help + slash catalog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobocop2/lilbee/gh-pages/demos/tui-palette.gif)

## Agent setup

Each agent demo ships with a drop-in [`AGENTS.md`](../examples/agent-integration/AGENTS.md), a
[`lilbee-worker` subagent](../examples/agent-integration/.opencode/agents/lilbee-worker.md) that
handles the long-running ops (`lilbee_add`, `lilbee_sync`, `lilbee_crawl`,
`lilbee_model_pull`), and the
[`lilbee-mcp` skill](../src/lilbee/skills/lilbee_mcp/SKILL.md) (opencode / Claude Skill
format) that documents every MCP tool with a quick-vs-long split. The agent runs
on the dev's default cloud model (MiniMax M2.7); the lilbee library stays local.
On screen, inline: `# lilbee_<tool>` for each tool call,
`Lilbee-Worker Task: Index ...` whenever indexing is delegated to the subagent,
and the cited answer.

## Written walkthroughs

For longer side-by-side comparisons and benchmarks, see
[`docs/benchmarks/`](benchmarks/):

- [Godot level generator](benchmarks/godot-level-generator.md): lilbee as a
  retrieval backend for an AI coding agent, with a side-by-side against a pure
  web-search baseline.
- [Vision OCR model comparison](benchmarks/vision-ocr.md): output quality and
  retrieval quality across vision OCR backends on a scanned PDF.
