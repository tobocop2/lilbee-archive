"""Typed service container: single point of access for all singletons.

All runtime dependencies (provider, store, embedder, reranker, concepts,
clusterer, searcher, worker pool) are created lazily on first call to
``get_services()`` and cached for the process lifetime. Tests call
``reset_services()`` between runs.

``build_services(config)`` is the construction seam: it builds a full container
against an arbitrary Config without touching the process-global singleton. The
library API (:class:`lilbee.Lilbee`) builds one per instance and installs it for
the duration of each call via :func:`services_scope`, so ingest code reaching for
``get_services()`` resolves the caller's container. The override is a ContextVar,
so ``reset_services`` / ``set_services`` / ``peek_services`` (which operate only
on the global singleton) never see it.
