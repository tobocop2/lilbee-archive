"""lilbee's embedder exposed as a xberg plugin embedding backend.

xberg's semantic chunker needs embeddings to detect topic boundaries. Registering
this backend routes those embeddings to lilbee's own embedder (whatever model the
fleet serves), so the model that vectorizes chunks for retrieval is the same one
that decides where chunks split. Without it, xberg falls back to its bundled ONNX
preset, a different model.
