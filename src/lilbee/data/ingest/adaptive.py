"""Adaptive ingest concurrency: hill-climb to the hardware's throughput knee.

The extraction-admission limit (how many documents are in their compute phase at
once) can run in one of three modes, chosen by ``LILBEE_INGEST_CONCURRENCY``:

- ``static`` -- a fixed limit (the pipeline's ``_max_concurrent()``); the proven
  default and the guaranteed-safe fallback.
- ``adaptive-conservative`` / ``adaptive-aggressive`` -- a background controller
  resizes the limit every few seconds, climbing while throughput still improves
  and backing off the instant a safety signal (CPU, free RAM, GPU temperature)
  says the box is under pressure.

The control law is a safety-gated AIMD hill-climb on smoothed throughput. The
only thing that pushes the limit up is throughput still improving, so the fixed
point is *this box's* real operating knee rather than a hardcoded utilization
target (BBR / Kleinrock). GPU utilization is used only as a saturation veto, never
as a setpoint. Multiplicative decrease on any danger signal is AIMD's proven
fast-safe retreat; EWMA smoothing plus an asymmetric dead band and a one-step slew
limit keep it from oscillating (CLR ThreadPool hill-climbing, TCP Vegas).

``decide`` is a pure function -- the whole control law with no clock, asyncio, or
hardware -- so the policy is unit-tested with plain numbers. ``ResizableGate`` and
``AdaptiveController`` are the async machinery around it.
