"""Worker processes for bulk ingest: one GIL per worker.

Bulk ingest throughput is concurrent embeds divided by their latency, and a
single process is limited in how many it can keep in flight -- a ``--gil``
profile of the 8.8M-passage MS MARCO ingest charges that dispatch ~37% of
GIL-held time, file I/O ~13% and asyncio ~9%, diffuse with no single hotspot to
remove. More processes raise that ceiling only by raising the aggregate
concurrency: an 8-worker A/B that kept the total in flight unchanged measured
1.00x with the GPUs still at 63%, so the process count alone buys nothing.

Only per-file production (extract, chunk, embed) runs here. The parent keeps
the plan, the single LanceDB writer, skip markers, move detection,
reconciliation, progress and cancellation, so the one-index invariant holds by
construction rather than by a merge step.

Workers never build an engine; they attach to the parent's (see
``SwapManager.bind``), because a second fleet would double-book the GPUs. That
makes starting it the parent's job: the engine otherwise comes up lazily on the
first embed, and in this path the parent dispatches every file and never embeds,
so nothing would start it and every worker would fail to attach. The parent
warms it before the first worker spawns and holds it for the whole run.
