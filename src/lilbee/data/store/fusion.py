"""Reciprocal-rank fusion of the vector, BM25, and optional title arms.

Each arm contributes ``(K + 1) / (K + rank)`` for the rows it retrieved
(rank is 1-based, K = 60, the standard RRF constant); a row's canonical
score is the weight-normalized sum of its arm contributions, so it lives
in [0, 1] and a row ranked first by every arm scores exactly 1. Rows seen
by only one arm score that arm's share of the total weight, which still
places an arm's top hit above every row deep in the other arms: the
property that keeps a lexical-only identifier match visible next to dense
neighbors. The vector arm weighs 1; the chunk-BM25 arm weighs
``lexical_weight`` (1.0 = equal voice, lower lets a strong dense arm
dominate); the optional title arm weighs ``title_weight``. Weights rescale
the shares without leaving the canonical range.

Scores normalize against the configured weight budget, not the per-query
adapted ``lexical_weight`` or whether a given query's title arm returned rows
(see ``fuse_arms``'s *weight_total*). That fixed denominator keeps scores on
one scale across queries and across the sub-searches a caller merges, so
``min_relevance_score`` stays a usable floor.

Rank fusion is deliberate. A convex combination of normalized raw scores
(``alpha * vector_similarity + (1 - alpha) * normalized_bm25``) was tried
here and measurably regressed graded precision: cosine similarities sit
in a high narrow band, giving every dense neighbor a floor that outranks
lexically-certain rows, and no blend weight fixes that asymmetry. Ranks
are scale-free, so neither arm's score distribution can crowd out the
other. Arm depth matters as much as the formula: rows both arms rank
mid-pool accumulate two contributions, so deep candidate pools crowd out
single-arm certainty; the hybrid path therefore feeds fusion arms of
exactly ``top_k`` rows.
