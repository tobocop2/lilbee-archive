Single-GPU chat ctx lives in ``engine_params.resolve_chat_ctx``; this is its
multi-GPU counterpart, sizing the per-slot context against the busiest card's

    placement reserves KV for one full window, while a split whose cards hold
    several may serve up to ``_CHAT_SLOTS`` of them. What keeps that honest is
    the per-device check below against real free bytes, not the placement
    reserve. Falls to the floor when even the floor overflows.
