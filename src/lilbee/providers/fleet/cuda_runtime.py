"""Put the CUDA 12 runtime wheels on the engine's library search path.

Driver-only GPU images (common on RunPod) ship ``libcuda.so`` from the kernel driver
but not the CUDA 12 runtime that llama-server links (``libcudart.so.12``,
``libcublas.so.12``, ``libnvrtc.so.12``). The bundled engine now carries those beside
the binary and resolves them through its baked ``$ORIGIN`` rpath, so this module is
the fallback for an engine built elsewhere: installing lilbee with the ``cuda12``
extra pulls the ``nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12`` / ``nvidia-cublas-cu12`` /
``nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12`` wheels, which carry those libraries under
``site-packages/nvidia``. :func:`cuda_runtime_env` adds their ``lib`` directories to
the spawned server's ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` -- the path can't be a baked rpath because
the wheels' location is only known at install time.
