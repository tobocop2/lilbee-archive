"""Coalesce concurrent embed requests into few large ones during bulk ingest.

A corpus of single-chunk documents (MS MARCO passages, tweets, log lines) drives
one embed request per document. The ingest fan-out runs each file on its own
thread, so hundreds of one-passage ``/v1/embeddings`` calls are in flight at
once, but the GIL serializes their per-request Python work (request build, JSON
parse, base64 decode, vector materialization) at a few milliseconds each. That
caps aggregate throughput near ~150 passages/sec no matter how fast or numerous
the GPUs are: the cards starve because the client cannot emit requests fast
enough, not because they cannot compute. ``embed_batch_sequences`` never helps
because each caller only ever hands the client one sequence.

This merges the concurrent one-passage calls back into full batches. A single
batcher thread drains the submission queue into groups sized toward
``embed_batch_sequences`` and hands each group to a bounded dispatch pool, so the
fixed per-request cost is paid once per batch instead of once per passage while
the batches still fan out across replicas. The size is a fill target, not a hard
cap: a multi-text request can carry a group past it, and the client re-splits by
token budget downstream regardless. Build-vs-buy: no off-the-shelf
in-process coalescer fits the fleet's failover routing and token-budget
sub-batching, and the retired ``llama_cpp_provider`` batch queue set the in-repo
precedent; this is the same idea rebuilt at the current fleet boundary.

Coalescing is scoped twice. A ContextVar limits it to bulk ingest, so the
interactive query and chat paths keep their direct, latency-free dispatch. A
fleet-size gate limits it to fleets big enough for dispatch to be the bottleneck:
an A/B on the same 50k subset regressed to 0.82x on a GPU-bound 2xA40, while
8xA40 (153 docs/s) and 4xH200 (152 docs/s) both sat at the ~150 docs/s ceiling
this removes. See ``FleetProvider._fleet_is_dispatch_bound``.
