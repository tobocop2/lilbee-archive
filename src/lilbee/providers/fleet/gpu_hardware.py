"""Which GPU vendors are physically installed, read from the OS device tree.

The Vulkan loader cannot answer this. Creating an instance loads every installed
ICD, which is the crash the ICD disable exists to prevent, so the answer has to
come from the OS: Linux reads the PCI display controllers out of sysfs, Windows
reads the PnP display-adapter class out of the registry.

An installed ICD manifest is not evidence of hardware. Mesa ships every vendor's
driver together on Linux (a Flatpak runtime always carries all of them), and a
Windows manifest outlives the card it arrived with.

Read directly rather than through pyudev or WMI: this is one attribute read per
device on either platform, and neither dependency earns its place for that.
