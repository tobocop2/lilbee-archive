"""Ask the host's Vulkan loader what ggml is going to see.

Probes the loader via ``ctypes`` for the facts the engine's ``--list-devices``
text does not carry: each adapter's device type, its ``deviceUUID``, whether it
supports the one feature ggml requires of it, and how much of its memory is
actually free. Placement uses these to agree with the engine about which devices
exist and how big they are; where the two disagree, a fleet gets sized against
hardware llama-server never uses.

It deliberately does not choose a device. Selection belongs to ggml, which
applies its own type filter, support check and same-UUID dedup at launch;
pinning through ``GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` would switch all three off, so
Vulkan devices are pinned by the name the engine printed or not at all.
