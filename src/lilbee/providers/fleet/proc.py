"""Run a short-lived subprocess with a bounded reap.

``subprocess.run``'s timeout path waits indefinitely for the killed child to be
reaped, so a process wedged in uninterruptible I/O (a GPU driver, a stuck
parser) hangs the caller forever. This kills the child's process group and
abandons it after a bounded wait if it will not die, so a wedged child costs a
bounded wait rather than a permanent hang.

    and awaited for at most *kill_wait_s* on timeout and on any other abort -- a
    Ctrl-C reaches this process, not the child's own session -- then the

    *bind_lifetime* additionally binds the child to this process, for a child
    that holds a resource nothing can reclaim by record (the device probe holds
    a GPU context and writes no state file). It is off by default because the
    Windows binding leaks a job-object handle per spawn by design, which is
