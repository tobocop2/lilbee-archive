"""FleetProvider: the local llama-server engine for every role.

On first use it plans GPU placement and starts one llama-swap process that fronts
a llama-server per configured role (chat/embed/rerank/vision) co-resident behind a
single OpenAI endpoint; each call routes to that endpoint by role id. There is no
in-process fallback, so a missing role surfaces a user-facing ``ProviderError``.
Model management (list/show/capabilities) reads the registry and GGUF headers
directly and needs no running server.
