"""FleetProvider: the local llama-server engine for every role.

On first use it plans GPU placement and starts one llama-swap process per
configured role (chat/embed/rerank/vision), each fronting that role's
llama-server(s); each call routes to its role's proxy by replica model id.
Per-role processes let a reload restart only the roles whose launches changed,
so a placement or model change never unloads an untouched role's model. There
is no in-process fallback, so a missing role surfaces a user-facing
``ProviderError``. Model management (list/show/capabilities) reads the registry
and GGUF headers directly and needs no running server.
