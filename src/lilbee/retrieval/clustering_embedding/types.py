    unrelated TypedDict with a different field set used across ingest.

    ``tokens`` is a derived cache of ``_tokenize_for_tf(text)``. It is
    computed here rather than at each construction site: TF-IDF labeling
    silently degrades to fallback labels when a record carries no tokens,
    so the invariant is structural instead of caller discipline. ``slots``
    keeps the per-record footprint down, since one record is materialized
    per corpus chunk.
