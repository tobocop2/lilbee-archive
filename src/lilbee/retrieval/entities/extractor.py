"""Two-phase typed entity extraction.

Phase 1 (cheap): an LLM reads a stratified sample of chunks and proposes the
corpus-specific type schema, persisted as machine state inside the index
before any expensive pass runs (see :mod:`schema`; nothing to review or edit).

Phase 2 (scales with corpus): each type is found by the cheapest extractor
that can serve it: compiled regex for identifier-shaped types, spaCy labels
for the general ones, and an LLM only for types neither can catch. Cost is
therefore dominated by how many LLM-kind types the schema keeps.
