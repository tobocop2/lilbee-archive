"""Automatic entity-extraction lifecycle, run by sync.

Turning ``entity_extraction`` on is the whole user interaction. Sync does
the rest: the first run samples the indexed chunks, induces a schema, and
extracts across the whole index; later runs extract new files at ingest
(see ``pipeline._build_entity_records``). The schema is machine state
persisted inside the index, so it travels with the data and there is
nothing for the user to manage.

The taxonomy keeps up with the corpus on its own. A library that grows a
new kind of document would otherwise keep answering with the type set
induced on day one, so sync re-induces from a fresh sample once the corpus
has grown materially since the schema was written, and unions in any type
the schema has never seen. Re-induction that proposes nothing new costs one
sampled chat call and no extraction pass.

Extraction is idempotent: every full pass clears previously extracted
rows first, so an interrupted pass, or a schema that gained a type, can
never double-count.
