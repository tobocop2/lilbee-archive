"""Query intent detection: known-item lookups and corpus aggregates.

Top-k similarity retrieval answers topical questions. Two other question
shapes reach the same pipe and fail structurally:

- A known-item lookup ("summarize survey_214.pdf") names the thing it
  wants; the answer is a document, not a ranking.
- An aggregate ("how many documents mention the observatory") is a property
  of the whole corpus; the top 20 of 500k chunks cannot count anything.

Detection here is deterministic and deliberately conservative: a missed
route degrades to topical retrieval, which handles the query the way it
always has, while a false positive would hijack a topical question. Every
pattern therefore requires an explicit structural cue.

Language-specific patterns live in ``retrieval.language`` packs; the logic
here consumes the active pack, so another language is an added pack, not an
edited parser. Only language-neutral shapes (filenames, quoting, token
splitting) are defined in this module.
