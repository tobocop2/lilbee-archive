"""Auto-extraction of durable memories from a chat turn.

A small LLM pass over the user's message and the assistant's answer that
proposes durable facts/preferences worth remembering. The model is asked for
a strict JSON array; parsing is defensive (a non-conforming reply yields no
memories rather than an error). Callers store the results, which the user can
review and remove in ``/memories``.
