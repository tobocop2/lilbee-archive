"""Neighbor-window expansion: widen retrieved passages with adjacent chunks.

A hit that lands in the middle of an argument loses the sentences before and
after it. After context selection, each selected chunk pulls up to N adjacent
chunks per side from its own source and merges them into one contiguous
passage, deduplicating the overlap text adjacent chunks share from chunking.
The widened passage keeps the original chunk's score and citation identity;
only its text and page/line span change.
