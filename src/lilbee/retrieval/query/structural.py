"""Detect document-structure chunks that dilute retrieval precision.

Flags two classes: tables of contents (generic), and classification-banner
cover/title pages. Both carry a document's title and section words but never
*answer* a substantive question. The detector is deliberately conservative:
it only flags chunks that are unambiguously structural, so a false negative
(some noise slips through) is preferred to a false positive (dropping real
content).
