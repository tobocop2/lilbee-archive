"""Cross-process locks: LanceDB write locking and the server singleton.

Write locking combines an in-process mutex with a cross-process file lock
(filelock) so separate processes also coordinate writes. Read consistency is
handled by LanceDB's built-in MVCC via ``read_consistency_interval`` in
``lilbee.data.store``. The server lock makes ``lilbee serve`` a singleton per
data dir.
