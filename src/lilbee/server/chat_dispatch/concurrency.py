class ChatGate:
    """Admit up to the backend's live slot capacity; the rest wait FIFO, then 429.

    Capacity is read at admission time, not fixed when the gate is created, so a
    model swap or provider change that changes the slot count takes effect at
    once, and a single in-process model (capacity 1) is never oversubscribed.
    The fleet reports its ``--parallel`` slot count, so its continuous-batching
    slots are actually used instead of one request at a time. The latest count
    any caller reports is remembered, so a capacity increase also admits the
    waiters that are already queued rather than leaving them to time out
    against a backend that now has room.

    Hand-rolled on purpose, and the reason is worth keeping because the obvious
    replacement almost fits. ``anyio.CapacityLimiter`` has a runtime-settable
    ``total_tokens`` that would make a capacity increase wake waiters for free,
    but it binds each token to the borrowing task and raises ``RuntimeError``
    when another task releases it. Slots here are released from wherever cleanup
    happens first, including a response's after-send hook, which is not the task
    that acquired. ``asyncio.Semaphore`` allows the cross-task release but has no
    live capacity. Neither fits until the streaming cleanup paths are collapsed
    onto one task.

    Slots are *handed to* waiters rather than merely signalled. Waking a waiter
    reserves its slot in the same synchronous step, and a request arriving while
    a waiter is queued joins the back of the queue instead of testing the
    counter. Without both, a newcomer could take the slot in the window between
    the wake-up and the woken waiter resuming, and the waiter would rejoin at
    the tail: the requests that had waited longest would be overtaken
    repeatedly and would be the ones to time out.
