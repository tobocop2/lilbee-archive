"""Setup routes: status and bootstrap for optional runtime components.

Currently exposes Playwright Chromium bootstrap (needed for /crawl). The
SSE event sequence mirrors what the TUI does in
``TaskBarController.ensure_chromium`` so a stream consumer can render a
matching ``setup`` progress indicator.

Endpoints:
    GET  /setup/crawler/status → { installed, package_installed,
                                   chromium_installed, component, browsers_path }
    POST /setup/crawler         → text/event-stream of setup_start →
                                   setup_progress → setup_done → done
