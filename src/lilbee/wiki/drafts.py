"""Draft review surface. List, diff, accept, reject wiki drafts.

Wiki generation routes pages to ``wiki/drafts/`` when the content
drift against an existing page exceeds the configured threshold or
when the faithfulness score falls below it. Without a review
surface drafts accumulate with no exit ramp, so this module exposes
the four operations a reviewer needs: see what is pending, diff
against the published version, accept (publish the page, register its
citations, re-index its chunks), or reject (delete the draft file).

    - **PENDING-PARSE** (batched-generation parser could not recover

      winning slug, overwrites the winning page with this draft's
      body, re-indexes, deletes the collision marker.

    rows are created: the citation block embedded in the draft body is
    re-parsed, verified against the chunks of the sources its
    frontmatter names, and written under the published ``wiki_source``.
    The published body is rendered from that same set, so its footnotes
    and its rows cannot disagree.

    Sequence for drift/collision: write the published file first,
    register citations and re-index next, delete the draft last. If a
    later step raises (chunker, embedder, LanceDB contention), the
    draft file stays on disk so the user can retry ``accept``: both
    the citation replace and ``index_wiki_page`` are idempotent on the
    same ``wiki_source``. A body that indexed nothing is a failed step
