    was coherent). This pre-check asserts three invariants:

    1. The first ``# `` heading must be a sanity-valid label per
       :func:`is_valid_label`. A heading like ``| | designer`` fails
       the structural-char gate even though it contains the cleaned
       display name as a substring.
    2. The cleaned display name must appear in the heading as a
       case-insensitive substring. Covers LLM drift where the
       heading names a different concept than requested.
    3. The body must mention the display name at least once outside
       the heading. Covers the "LLM talked about something adjacent
