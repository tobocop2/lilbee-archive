"""The wiki's page index: every page that could exist, generated or not.

NER extraction names every entity in the corpus and its chunk refs without
spending an LLM call, so the browse tree can list every page as soon as a sync
finishes and a body can be generated only when someone asks for that page. A
build costs one call per source document, which scales with library size rather
than with what the reader opens; this is the half of that cost that is free.

Only entities are enumerable this way. LLM-curated concepts come from the
per-source batched call, so they keep arriving published from an explicit
``lilbee wiki build``.
