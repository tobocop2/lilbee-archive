"""The ROCm bundler packs the runtime the engine links, discovered rather than listed.

The wheel this guards exists so an AMD user needs a kernel driver and nothing else.
These tests cover the walk that packs it: every dependency edge is declared by the
fixture, so a library the bundler fails to follow is a test failure rather than a
user's crash, and none of it needs a GPU or a six-hour build.

Whether the result actually loads on a machine without ROCm is settled elsewhere, by
``tools/qa/assert_rocm_bundle_loads.sh`` running it through a real ld.so in a container.
