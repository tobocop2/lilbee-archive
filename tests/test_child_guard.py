"""The plumbing that binds a spawned llama-swap to this process.

The kernel-level behaviour (PR_SET_PDEATHSIG firing on Linux, a job object killing
its members on Windows) can only be verified on those platforms and is covered in
CI, not here. What is verified here is platform dispatch, the process-lifetime
spawner thread, and that every failure path falls back to a plain spawn so a
binding problem never fails a launch.
