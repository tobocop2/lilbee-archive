"""A model bigger than the GPUs is a partial offload, not a refusal.

The engine picks how many layers fit and keeps the rest in system memory. That
only works if lilbee launches it, and the refusal meant the fit never ran: the
role was skipped and chat was unavailable until the user hand-tuned
n_gpu_layers, which is the state the offload work was opened about.
