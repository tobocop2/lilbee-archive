"""Picking a port is a reservation until the child actually binds it.

llama-swap binds a member port lazily, on that member's first request, so every
port lilbee hands out is unbound for an unbounded stretch. Probing with a socket
and closing it proves the port was free at that instant and reserves nothing, so
a picker that always searches from the same place hands the next caller exactly
what it gave the last one.
