"""Assert a lilbee-engine wheel carries the backend it claims, and the runtime it links.

Two checks, both on the wheel's payload, because neither failure is visible in a
build log or on a driverless CI runner.

THE BACKEND IT CLAIMS. Every flavor is built to produce one ggml backend library:
rocm builds ``libggml-hip.so``, vulkan ``libggml-vulkan.so``, and so on. A wheel
without its own is a build whose backend flag never took effect, and cmake makes
that silent: an unknown ``-D`` is cached unused rather than failing, so the build
succeeds and emits a CPU-only engine. That is not hypothetical. The published rocm
wheel carried nothing but ``libggml-cpu.so`` for as long as the flag was spelled
``GGML_HIPBLAS``, which upstream had renamed to ``GGML_HIP``, and no gate looked.

THE RUNTIME IT LINKS. A CUDA build of llama-server links cudart, cublas and
cublasLt dynamically. Only libcuda / nvcuda comes from the NVIDIA driver, so the
rest have to ship inside the wheel beside the binary. When they are missing,
Windows dies at process start on a user's machine and Linux silently falls back to
CPU. Non-CUDA wheels are checked the other way, that they carry no CUDA runtime at
all, so a copy step can't quietly bloat every backend.

Pass ``--backend`` at build time, where the flavor is known but the wheel has no
build tag yet. Without it the flavor is read from the ``-1.<backend>-`` tag, which
is what a released wheel carries.

Usage:
    assert_engine_bundle.py [--backend <flavor>] <wheel> [<wheel> ...]
